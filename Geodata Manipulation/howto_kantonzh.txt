for kanton z√ºrich:

get AV data

split av data into veg, pav files with the python script in this folder

for buildings: heights are not available directly outside of zurich. use zonal statistics for that. there, no correction required (due to definitions in zurich).

vegetation: works fine with nDOM_veg heights, polygonize then, and so on as described in other txt file.
